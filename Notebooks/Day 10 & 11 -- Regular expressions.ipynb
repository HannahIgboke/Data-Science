    "Regular expression is a tool used in text processing to describe and match patterns in strings. It is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is it useful?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pattern matching**: to search for specific patterns within a larger body of text. E.g finding specific words, dates, email addresses and other strutured information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Text extraction**: useful to extract pieces of information from a document. This information can be anything from a house address to most repeeated phrases in a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data validation & pattern validation**: useful for validating input data. E.g, checking if the phone number matches the 11 didgit pattern for nigerian contact numbers. It us used to validate whether an input adheres to a format, such as checking if a password being created has at least one capital letter, a digit and special symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Search and replace**: useful for cases where you need to replace specific patterns with something else. This is especially useful in data cleaning and transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Web scraping and data extraction**: to locate and extract specific elements and information/data from HTML pages\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parsing and tokenization**: to break down text into smaller units or tokens. Useful in NLP problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Log file analysis**: used in searching and parsing log files, allowin you to extract important information or identify patterns of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Search engines and information retrieval**: used for matching user queries to relevant content on websites or databases\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **URL routing and validation**: useful for validating URLs to ensure they follow the correct format and extracting speicuf parameters from them\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Network security and firewall rules**: it allows the ability to define custom rules for allowing or blocking specific types of traffic nbased on patterns in network traffic logs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extracting meta data from documents**: by parsing documents like PDFs and word documents regex can extract metadata like the titles, authors, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **URL rewriting in web servers**: modifying URLs on the fly to improve SEO or to direct traffic to specific pages"
